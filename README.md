FRIENDLYBOT CHATBOT USING SPEECH RECOGNITION

Fast-moving modern times leave many lonely, bereft of the
comfort of an ever-ready chatting partner. This seriously affects their
mental well-being. Keeping all this in view, this project aims at
developing a Friendlybot chatbot to provide a companion through an AIbased digital companion that will offer text and speech-based natural and
meaningful conversations. Chatbot with its intelligent responses and
interactions with the user makes a person feel accompanied through NLP
techniques and by employing NLTK, Tensorflow, Keras, and Tkinter.
The user-friendly interface allows one to switch seamlessly between text
and speech modes for broad accessibility. In the future, there is the
development of a web interface that will provide user authentication,
database support, increase in the dataset, use of ChatGPT API to improve
responses, and feedback to build on continuous improvement measures.
The Friendlybot chatbot has been rigorously tested, showing much
promise to become a tool in reducing loneliness and providing emotional
support for users.
